2. **Roast all vegetables at once** - use throughout week
3. **Brown all ground turkey** - portion and season differently
4. **Make all sandwiches at once** - wrap individually

### Storage System
1. **Label everything** with day to use
2. **FIFO system** - First In, First Out
3. **Clear containers** - see what you have
4. **Prep containers** - portion meals directly

### Multi-Use Prep

- **Cooked rice:** Dinner sides, fried rice, soup addition
- **Roasted vegetables:** Dinner sides, lunch wraps, breakfast scrambles
- **Cooked beans:** Breakfast burritos, lunch wraps, dinner sides

## Emergency Shortcuts

When time is tight:
1. **Breakfast:** Overnight oats or yogurt parfait (pre-made)
2. **Lunch:** Pre-made sandwich or leftovers
3. **Dinner:** One-pan meals (sheet pan or stir-fry)

## Clean-Up Efficiency
1. **Clean as you go** during prep
2. **Reuse cutting boards** - veggies first, then proteins
3. **Line sheet pans** with parchment
4. **Batch similar tasks** - all chopping, then all cooking

## Success Tips
- Don't prep everything - some things are better fresh
- Keep emergency meals on hand (canned soup, frozen meals)
- Involve both adults in prep for faster completion
- Play music or podcasts during prep time
- Reward yourselves after big prep sessions
