# Meal Prep Tips & Strategies (For 2 Adults)

## Weekly Prep Schedule

### Weekend Before Week 1

- **Chop** onions and garlic for the week

### Mid-Week 1
- **Portion** leftover chicken for Day 4 fried rice
- **Soak** beans overnight if using dried
- **Prep** vegetables for stir-fry

### Weekend Before Week 2

## Storage Tips

### Cooked Proteins

- Cooked salmon: 2-3 days in fridge
- Cooked beans: 5 days in fridge

### Cooked Grains

- Store in airtight containers

### Vegetables
- Cut vegetables: Store in water to maintain crispness
- Roasted vegetables: 3-5 days in fridge

## Time-Saving Hacks

1. **Double recipes** when possible - freeze extras
2. **Pre-chop** vegetables when you buy them
3. **Cook grains** in large batches
4. **Use one pan** meals to minimize cleanup
5. **Repurpose leftovers** creatively

## Kitchen Tools That Help

## Batch Cooking Guide

### Rice
- Cook 3-4 cups dry rice at once
- Makes about 9-12 cups cooked (enough for 4-5 meals)
- Portion into 2-person meal containers

### Proteins
- Brown ground turkey in 1 lb portions
- Season portions differently for variety
- One whole chicken feeds 2 people for 2 dinners plus leftovers

### Vegetables

## Leftover Transformations

- **Roasted chicken** → Fried rice, sandwiches, soup
- **Turkey chili** → Over baked potato, with eggs, in tacos
- **Cooked quinoa** → Breakfast porridge, added to soups
- **Rice** → Fried rice, rice pudding, added to soups

## Money-Saving Tips

1. **Buy in bulk**: Rice, oats, onions, potatoes
2. **Use everything**: Save vegetable scraps for broth
3. **Stretch proteins**: Add more beans to meat dishes
4. **Shop sales**: Adjust vegetables based on prices
5. **Generic brands**: For pantry staples

## Emergency Backup Meals

If plans change, these combinations work:
- Oatmeal with nuts and frozen berries
