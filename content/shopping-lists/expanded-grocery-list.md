## Shopping Tips
1. Buy store brands for basics (eggs, milk, bread)
2. Check for sales on proteins - can substitute ground turkey with ground chicken
3. Frozen vegetables are often cheaper and last longer
4. Buy bananas slightly green so they last the full week
5. Generic Greek yogurt is much cheaper than name brands
